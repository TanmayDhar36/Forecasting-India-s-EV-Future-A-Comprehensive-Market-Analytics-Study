# About the Project

## Overview
"Forecasting India's EV Future: A Comprehensive Market Analytics Study" is an in-depth research initiative aimed at analyzing the growth and potential of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market in India from 2001 to 2024. This project explores sales trends, consumer behavior, manufacturer performance, vehicle classifications, and charging infrastructure development. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and statistical modeling, the study provides actionable insights for manufacturers, policymakers, and investors to navigate the evolving EV landscape. The project forecasts market trends up to 2029, estimating a market value growth from ₹1.5 lakh crore (~$18 billion) in 2024 to over ₹5 lakh crore (~$60 billion) by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36%.

## Objectives
The primary goals of this study are to:
- Identify high-growth EV categories, such as two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and four-wheelers, based on historical and projected demand.
- Target geographic regions and demographic segments, including urban professionals, fleet operators, and middle-class families, for optimal EV adoption.
- Assess the impact of sales trends, charging infrastructure, government policies, and economic factors on market opportunities.
- Segment the market using geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral criteria to highlight states with significant growth potential.
- Offer strategic recommendations to enhance market penetration, infrastructure development, and investment strategies.

## Data Sources
The analysis is built upon a robust collection of datasets sourced from the Vahaan4 and Sarthi Dashboards, which provide comprehensive vehicle registration and infrastructure data:
- **EV Maker by Place.csv**: Details EV manufacturers (e.g., Tata Motors, Hero Electric, Ather Energy) and their plant locations.
- **OperationalPC.csv**: Tracks the number of operational public charging stations across states, with over 15,000 stations recorded by 2024.
- **Vehicle Class - All.csv**: Records total vehicle registrations (electric and other fuel types) by category from 2001 to August 2024.
- **ev_cat_01-24.csv**: Documents EV manufacturing data by vehicle type over the same period.
- **ev_sales_by_makers_and_cat_15-24.csv**: Provides EV sales data by manufacturers and vehicle classes from 2015 to August 2024.

These datasets were cleaned to remove inconsistencies, such as commas in numerical fields and missing values, ensuring the reliability of the analysis.

## Methodology
The project employs a structured methodology to derive meaningful insights:
- **Data Cleaning**: Processed datasets to ensure consistency by converting numerical fields and handling missing or infinite values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed sales trends (2015–2024), identified top EV manufacturers, mapped charging infrastructure distribution, and evaluated vehicle class registrations.
- **Market Segmentation**: Applied K-Means clustering to segment states into three clusters—low adoption (21 states), high adoption (Delhi and Maharashtra), and moderate growth (11 states)—based on sales and infrastructure data, visualized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- **Forecasting**: Utilized a Linear Regression model trained on historical sales data (2015–2024) to predict EV sales for 2025–2029, integrating economic and policy factors.

## Key Findings
- **Sales Trends**: EV sales have surged, reaching over 1.2 million units in 2024, with two-wheelers leading at ~65% of the market, followed by three-wheelers (~30%) and four-wheelers (~15%).
- **Top Manufacturers**: Ola Electric Technologies Pvt Ltd (588,266 units), TVS Motor Company Pvt Ltd (318,445 units), and Ather Energy Pvt Ltd (236,387 units) dominate the market.
- **Charging Infrastructure**: Maharashtra (3,079 stations), Delhi (1,886 stations), and Karnataka (1,041 stations) lead in infrastructure, supporting adoption in urban areas.
- **Vehicle Class Distribution**: Two-wheelers account for 274,971,646 registrations, reflecting their affordability and practicality.
- **Market Segmentation**: Clusters highlight Delhi and Maharashtra as prime markets, with emerging opportunities in Gujarat and Karnataka, while 21 states require infrastructure investment.
- **Forecast**: The market is projected to grow to ₹5 lakh crore by 2030, driven by increasing adoption and policy support.

## Project Significance
This study provides a roadmap for stakeholders to capitalize on India’s EV market growth. By identifying high-potential segments and addressing infrastructure gaps, the project supports sustainable mobility and economic development. The findings are intended to guide manufacturers in product development, policymakers in infrastructure planning, and investors in strategic allocations.

## Future Directions
Future enhancements include incorporating real-time IoT data from vehicles, deploying deep learning models for more accurate predictions, and analyzing consumer sentiment through social media. Collaboration with industry stakeholders and government bodies will further refine the analysis and implementation strategies.
